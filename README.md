### Project Title
Bikeshare Analysis

### Description
In this project, I used Python analysed the data provided by bikeshare. This includes bikes usage data from three different cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The program prompts the user to state which city should be analysed and what month and day of the week should be filtered. Further, the user is able to then determine whether the first
five rows of the raw data should be displayed and whether they want to scroll down by iterations of five. Lastly, the program displays a multitude of statistics about the bike usage according
to the filters selected.
